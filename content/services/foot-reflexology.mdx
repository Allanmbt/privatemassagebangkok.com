Foot Reflexology is based on the principle that specific points on the feet correspond to different organs and systems throughout the body. By applying pressure to these reflex points, our therapists can promote healing and balance in the corresponding areas.

This ancient healing art is perfect for those who spend long hours on their feet, travelers recovering from jet lag, or anyone seeking a therapeutic treatment that doesn't require undressing.

## Benefits

- Reduced stress and tension
- Better sleep quality
- Enhanced energy levels

## What to Expect

You'll relax in a comfortable chair while your therapist works on your feet and lower legs. The treatment begins with a warm foot soak to soften the skin and relax the muscles.

Your therapist will then apply pressure to specific reflex points using thumbs, fingers, and a wooden stick. Some points may feel tender—this is normal and indicates areas that need attention.

Many clients find reflexology deeply relaxing and report feeling effects throughout their entire body, not just in their feet.
