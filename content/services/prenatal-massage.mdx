Prenatal Massage is specially adapted to support the health and comfort of expectant mothers. Our therapists are trained in safe positioning and techniques appropriate for each stage of pregnancy.

This gentle treatment helps alleviate common pregnancy discomforts like back pain, swollen ankles, and muscle tension, while providing a peaceful moment of relaxation for both mother and baby.

## Benefits

- Relief from back and joint pain
- Reduced swelling in hands and feet
- Improved sleep quality
- Decreased stress hormones
- Enhanced emotional well-being

## What to Expect

You'll be positioned comfortably on your side with supportive pillows, ensuring safety and comfort for both you and your baby. The massage uses gentle, flowing strokes with light to moderate pressure.

Special attention is given to areas that commonly experience tension during pregnancy—the lower back, hips, legs, and feet. Your therapist will avoid certain pressure points and techniques that are contraindicated during pregnancy.

Please note: We recommend prenatal massage only after the first trimester. Please consult with your healthcare provider before booking.
