Hot Stone Therapy combines the therapeutic benefits of heat with expert massage techniques. Smooth, heated basalt stones are placed on key points of your body and used as massage tools to deliver deep, penetrating warmth that melts away tension.

The heat from the stones helps muscles relax more quickly and deeply than traditional massage alone, allowing your therapist to work more effectively on areas of chronic tension. The result is a profoundly relaxing experience that soothes both body and mind.

## Benefits

- Deep muscle relaxation
- Improved circulation
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Relief from chronic pain
- Enhanced sense of well-being

## What to Expect

Your therapist will heat smooth basalt stones to the perfect temperature and place them on strategic points along your spine, in your palms, and between your toes. These stones help warm and relax your muscles before the massage begins.

During the massage, your therapist will use additional heated stones as massage tools, gliding them over your body with oil. The combination of heat, pressure, and skilled technique creates a uniquely soothing experience.

This treatment is perfect for those who love heat and want to experience massage at a deeper level of relaxation.
