Office Syndrome Relief is specifically designed for the modern professional. If you spend hours at a desk, staring at screens, or in meetings, you know the toll it takes on your neck, shoulders, and back. This specialized treatment targets the exact areas affected by prolonged sitting and poor posture.

Our therapists understand the unique challenges of office work and use a combination of techniques to release tension, improve circulation, and restore proper alignment. Say goodbye to headaches, neck pain, and shoulder stiffness.

## Benefits

- Relief from neck and shoulder pain
- Reduced headaches and eye strain
- Improved posture and spinal alignment
- Better circulation to upper body
- Increased energy and mental clarity

## What to Expect

Your session focuses primarily on the upper body—neck, shoulders, upper back, and arms. Your therapist will use a combination of deep tissue work, trigger point therapy, and stretching to release accumulated tension.

Special attention is given to common problem areas like the trapezius muscles, neck extensors, and the muscles around the shoulder blades. The treatment also includes work on the forearms and hands, which often hold tension from keyboard and mouse use.

Many clients report immediate relief from headaches and improved range of motion in the neck and shoulders. Regular sessions can help prevent the chronic pain patterns associated with office work.
