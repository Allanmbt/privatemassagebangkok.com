Swedish Massage is the foundation of Western massage therapy. This classic technique uses five basic strokes—effleurage, petrissage, friction, tapotement, and vibration—to promote relaxation, improve circulation, and ease muscle tension.

Perfect for those new to massage or anyone seeking pure relaxation without intense pressure. The gentle to moderate pressure makes this an ideal choice for stress relief and overall wellness.

## Benefits

- Full-body relaxation
- Improved blood circulation
- Reduced muscle tension
- Enhanced lymphatic drainage
- Better sleep quality

## What to Expect

Your therapist will use long, flowing strokes combined with kneading and circular movements on the topmost layers of muscles. The massage is performed with oil or lotion to allow smooth, gliding movements.

The pressure is generally light to moderate, though your therapist can adjust based on your preferences. This is an excellent introduction to massage therapy and a wonderful way to unwind.
