Experience authentic Traditional Thai Massage, an ancient healing art that has been practiced for over 2,500 years. This therapeutic treatment combines acupressure, assisted yoga postures, and rhythmic compression to restore balance and vitality.

Unlike oil massage, Thai massage is performed on a comfortable mat with you fully clothed in loose, comfortable attire. Your therapist uses hands, thumbs, elbows, forearms, and sometimes feet to apply pressure along energy lines and stretch your body.

## Benefits

- Improved flexibility and range of motion
- Enhanced energy flow
- Relief from muscle tension and stiffness
- Better posture and body alignment
- Mental clarity and stress reduction

## What to Expect

Your session begins with gentle compression and stretching to warm up your muscles. The therapist will guide you through various positions, applying pressure to specific points along your body's energy lines (Sen lines).

The treatment includes assisted yoga-like stretches that help release deep-seated tension and improve flexibility. Many clients describe the experience as both energizing and deeply relaxing.
