Deep Tissue Sport Massage is designed for those who need serious muscle work. Whether you're recovering from intense physical activity, dealing with chronic tension, or suffering from jet lag, this therapeutic treatment targets the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue.

Using firm pressure and slow strokes, our skilled therapists work to release chronic muscle tension, break down adhesions, and restore proper movement patterns. This is not a gentle relaxation massage—it's serious bodywork for serious results.

## Benefits

- Relief from chronic muscle pain
- Improved athletic performance and recovery
- Reduced inflammation and muscle soreness
- Better posture and movement patterns
- Faster recovery from injuries

## What to Expect

Your therapist will assess your areas of concern and customize the treatment to address your specific needs. The massage uses firm, sustained pressure and slow strokes to reach deeper layers of muscle and fascia.

You may experience some discomfort during the treatment as tight areas are released, but your therapist will work within your comfort level. Many clients report feeling immediate relief, though some soreness may occur in the following 24-48 hours as your body adjusts.

Perfect for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, or anyone dealing with chronic muscle tension and pain.
