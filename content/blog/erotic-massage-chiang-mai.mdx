Aromatherapy massage is where ancient healing wisdom meets modern wellness science. By combining the therapeutic benefits of massage with carefully selected essential oils, this treatment addresses both physical tension and emotional well-being.

## What is Aromatherapy Massage?

Aromatherapy massage integrates the healing properties of essential oils with traditional massage techniques. The oils are absorbed through the skin and inhaled, creating a multi-sensory experience that promotes deep relaxation and healing.

### The Dual Action

1. **Topical absorption**: Oils penetrate the skin, delivering therapeutic compounds to muscles and tissues
2. **Aromatherapy**: Scent molecules stimulate the limbic system, affecting emotions and stress response

## Popular Essential Oils and Their Benefits

### For Relaxation
- **Lavender**: Calms the nervous system, promotes sleep
- **Chamomile**: Soothes anxiety, reduces inflammation
- **Ylang Ylang**: Balances emotions, lowers blood pressure

### For Energy
- **Peppermint**: Invigorates the mind, relieves muscle fatigue
- **Eucalyptus**: Clears respiratory passages, boosts mental clarity
- **Rosemary**: Enhances focus, stimulates circulation

### For Pain Relief
- **Ginger**: Warms muscles, reduces inflammation
- **Black Pepper**: Improves circulation, eases muscle soreness
- **Marjoram**: Relaxes tight muscles, relieves cramps

### For Emotional Balance
- **Bergamot**: Uplifts mood, reduces stress
- **Frankincense**: Grounds emotions, promotes meditation
- **Sandalwood**: Calms anxiety, enhances presence

## The Science of Scent

Research shows that essential oils can:

- Reduce cortisol levels (stress hormone)
- Increase serotonin and dopamine (mood regulators)
- Enhance immune function
- Improve sleep quality
- Reduce perception of pain

The olfactory system has direct connections to the brain's emotional centers, making aromatherapy uniquely effective for stress-related conditions.

## What to Expect in Your Session

An aromatherapy massage typically includes:

1. **Consultation**: Discuss your needs and preferences
2. **Oil selection**: Choose blends for your specific goals
3. **Preparation**: Oils are diluted in carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, or sweet almond)
4. **Massage**: Flowing Swedish-style strokes with aromatic oils
5. **Integration**: Time to rest and absorb the benefits

## Customizing Your Experience

At CBODY Bangkok, we create custom blends based on:

- **Your goals**: Relaxation, energy, pain relief, or emotional balance
- **Personal preferences**: Scents you love (or want to avoid)
- **Skin sensitivity**: Gentle dilutions for sensitive skin

## Safety and Considerations

Essential oils are powerful plant medicines. We ensure:

- **Proper dilution**: Typically 2-3% in carrier oil
- **Quality oils**: Pure, therapeutic-grade essentials
- **Patch testing**: For those with sensitive skin
- **Contraindications**: Avoiding certain oils during pregnancy or with medical conditions

## Beyond the Massage Table

The benefits of aromatherapy extend beyond your session:

- **Lingering scent**: Oils remain on skin for hours, continuing their work
