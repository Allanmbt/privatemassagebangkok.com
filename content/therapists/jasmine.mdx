## Meet Jasmine — Shy-Cute, Graceful, and Calm

Jasmine brings a gentle, almost dreamy energy to Aloha Massage Chiang Mai. She’s petite yet elegant, with fair skin, soft features, and a naturally warm smile. Don’t let the shy first impression fool you—once the session starts, her touch is confident, steady, and quietly attentive, the kind that helps your mind slow down and your breathing settle.

### Massage Style & Focus

With **1 year of hands-on experience**, Jasmine has developed a relaxing **aromatherapy** flow that combines light to medium pressure with smooth transitions. Her goal is simple: melt away your travel tension without rushing a single moment.

She offers:  
- **Thai Massage** — traditional techniques with a softer rhythm and clear stretches  
- **Oil Massage** — silky aromatherapy strokes for full-body ease and better sleep  
- **ManSpa** — a refined, sensual-leaning session that stays professional and deeply relaxing  

> Tip: If you’ve had a long day of walking Old City lanes or working on a laptop, ask Jasmine to focus on neck, shoulders, and lower back. Her pacing and warm oil work are especially good there.

### Personality & Communication

Jasmine is **fluent in Thai** and speaks **basic English and Chinese**. She’s a little shy at first and appreciates kind, respectful guests. Once comfortable, she checks in with quiet questions and adapts pressure naturally. Off duty, she loves **music and reading**, which shows up in the steady, unhurried tempo of her sessions.
